# batocera-utilities
 A collection of small programs I have written to assist with Batocera development/documentation

# Licensing
 All code I have programmed is under the MIT license. This does not include scripts which I have based off of pre-existing code; those are covered by their upstream licenses which I've included a copy of in their subfolder.
